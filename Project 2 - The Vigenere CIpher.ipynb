You will begin by using frequency analysis to break the simpler Caesar cipher, which just shifts each letter of the alphabet forward by the same amount, and then move on to use the [Index of Coincidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_coincidence) to break Vigenère."

The **Caesar cipher** with key $\\kappa \\in \\mathbb{Z}$  encrypts a piece of text by changing each letter $a_i$ of the text to $a_{i+\\kappa \\pmod {27}}$, where $x \\pmod {27}$ means the remainder when you divide $x$ by 27. In other words, you move each letter forward $\\kappa$ places in the alphabet-plus-space `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz␣` (the ␣ character indicates a space), and if you go past space you wrap back round to a.\n",
